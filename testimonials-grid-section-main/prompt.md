Choose any two array elements X[i] and X[j] with X[i] > X[j]. Set X[i] = X[i] - X[j].

Repeat until no more subtractions are possible (because all array elements are equal).

It can be shown that whenever there is more than one possible choice of the pair i,j, it doesn't matter which pair you choose: the answer will be 
the same in the end.
